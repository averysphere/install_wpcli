# install_wpcli.sh
## Install Wordpress command-line utility, WP-CLI ##

To run the installation, `$ chmod +x install_wpcli.sh && sudo ./install_wpcli.sh`.

This script needs `wget` and the Internet. It also requires root privilege (or through sudo) to move downloaded .phar file to `/usr/local/bin`, otherwise use the regular way of calling .phar via the `php` command. You may also add present working directory to your $PATH but this requires careful consideration.
